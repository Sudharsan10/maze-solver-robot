Maze solver Robot is a program to drive a robot through a 16x16 maze using Depth First Search as it's path-planning algorithm. The program is integrated with Micro-mouse simulator a.k.a mms for visualizing the maze and the robot in real-time. 
The concepts of object-oriented programming, inheritance, and dynamic polymorphism were used to develop this project.

## Pre-requisites
This app depends on ```Qt5``` libraries. We can setup this up using apt-get package manager (for Debian linux) or conda virtual environment tool.

- setting up using pip installer
    > ```
    > sudo apt-get install qt5-default
    >```
    
## Quick start                                   
- Clone the repo in terminal using following command: 
    > ```
    > git clone https://github.com/Sudharsan10/maze-solver-robot.git
    > ```
    
    or download github repo as ```.zip``` and extract it in the desired location.
    
- If you would like to use latest micro-mouse simulator and maze files then do the following,   
    > ```
    > git clone https://github.com/mackorone/mms.git
    >```
    
    > ```
    > git clone git https://github.com/micromouseonline/mazefiles.git
    >```
    
    Note: To install and setup anaconda environment follow this [link](#https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) first 
    and visit this section again after successfully setting up the conda environment.

## Run instructions
To run the app, first finish the pre-requisites mentioned above, then
- Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repo and start the Micro-Mouse Simulator(mms) using the following command:
    > ```
    > cd mms/src
    > ```
    
    > ```
    > qmake && make
    > ``` 
    
    > ```
    > ../../mms/bin/mms
    > ```
    The last command will fire up the micro-mouse simulator.

If every requirement is fulfilled a window should open as follow,

## What's included
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping the classes under src directory. 
mazefiles and mms directories are submodules based out of third party repo. You'll see something like this:

```text
maze-solver-robot/
├── mazefiles/ ...
├── mms/ ...
├── docs/ ...
├── img/ ...
├── src/
|   ├── Algorithm/ ...
|   ├── API/ ...

├── main.cpp
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── README.md
```

## Documentation
For documentation related to the code you can refer the one provided under docs directory. 
A general outline explanantion with the help of flowcharts and images are provided in the following subsections,

3. [Depth First Search flowchart](#depth-first-search)
4. [Node Object Data Structure](#node-data-structure)
5. [Implementation](#implementation)
6. [Project Execution](#project-execution)
    
### 1 How to use <a id ='howtouse'></a>

Enter the initial state of the puzzle and goal state of the puzzle as shown in the fig below.
- Click on the + icon from the config section, you will get a window like this,
  <img src=".\img\add-mouse.png" width="100%" />

- Enter all the fields in the respective locations,  

    - **Name:** Any name of user choice to store the config.
    - **Directory:** The absolute path to the root directory of the project folder.
    - **Build Command:** It takes compiler that 'g++', '-std = c++14' is the c++ standard we used, then relative path to all the necessary .cpp 
    class files. If you haven't changed any of the files and project structure you can go ahead and copy paste the following command.
    
        > ```
        > g++ -std=c++14 main.cpp src/LandBasedRobot/landbasedrobot.cpp src/LandBasedWheeled/landbasedwheeled.cpp 
        > src/API/api.cpp src/Algorithm/algorithm.cpp src/LandBasedTracked/landbasedtracked.cpp src/Maze/maze.cpp
        > ```
   
    - **Run Command:**  use this command.
    
      >```./a.out``` 
      
    <img src=".\img\step-one.png" width="100%" />
- Then click, Build button and wait for it to turn green. If the previous step clears out then it will turn green indicating 
that we can run the simulator.
- To run click the Run and you will see the simulation of the robot exploring in the maze. 

### 2 Class Structure<a id='class-structure'></a>
The following figure explains the class structure for all the classes in the src directory

### 3 Depth First Search & Ideal Implementation<a id='depth-first-search'></a>
- Depth first search:
<img src=".\img\dfs-gif1.gif" width="100%" />
- General Implementation of DFS algorithm flowchart
<img src=".\img\dfs.png" width="100%" />
- Incorporating the DFS algorithm to solve the maze Flowchart
<img src=".\img\solver-implementation.png" width="100%" />

### 4 Node Object Data Structure<a id='node-data-structure'></a>
Since the above mentioned DFS algorithm and Solver has lot of redundancy loops like exploring or visiting same trail of 
path frequently. This is definitely a optimization issue, which has been resolved with the help of our own custom Node data 
structure and custom dfs and solver implementation algorithm.

- **Custom Implementation:**
